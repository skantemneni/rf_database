MySQL event scheduler configuration...
--------------------------------------------------

1.) 
---------------
Make sure the EVENT SCHEDULER is TURNED ON
edit my.ini or my.cnf files.....to add this line to the END...

# Turn ON the Event Scheduler
event_scheduler=ON

Note that the my.ini file is located here.....
[WINDOWS] C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\my.ini
[LINUX Amazon] /etc/my.cnf   -------------------------------------------MAY NOT WORK if put at the end...
            (May have to do it manually after each restart of mysql with the following statement: 'SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON')
[LINUX Ctrls] /etc/mysql/my.cnf


2.) 
---------------
MySQL uses a special thread called event schedule thread to execute all scheduled events. You can see the status of event scheduler thread by executing the following command:

SHOW PROCESSLIST;

This should show atleast one user with name 'event_scheduler';

If not, Run....
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
(NOTE:  This can only be run as root.)


3.) 
---------------
And try again...
SHOW PROCESSLIST;

This should show atleast one user with name 'event_scheduler';
